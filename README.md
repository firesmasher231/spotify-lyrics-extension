# ðŸŽµ Spotify Lyrics Returner ðŸŽµ

Welcome to **Spotify Lyrics Returner** â€“ the ultimate tool to bring back lyrics to your Spotify web player for free! ðŸŽ¤âœ¨

## About the Project

Spotify put the lyrics behind a paywall, my friend still wanted access to those sweet lyrics. The result? This spaghetti-o code that just about works.

Entire thing was coded in about two hours so apologies for the mess of the code :P

(and yes this readme is chatgpt generated)

## Features

- **ðŸŽ¶ Fetch Lyrics**: Automatically fetches lyrics for the currently playing song.
- **ðŸ”„ Real-time Updates**: Updates lyrics as you navigate through your playlist.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Any Chromium based browser

### Steps to install stable build

1. **Download the rar file**:

   - Get the latest `.rar` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/spotify-lyrics-returner/releases) section.
   - Extract the `.rar` file to a folder

2. **Enable Developer Mode in your browser**:

   - Go to `{YOUR BROWSER HERE}://extensions/` and toggle the "Developer mode" switch on the top right. (Replace `{YOUR BROWSER HERE}` with `chrome`, `edge`, `opera`, etc.)

3. **Install the Extension**:

   - Confirm the installation by clicking "Add extension".

4. **Enjoy Your Lyrics**:

## How It Works

This extension uses a content script to detect changes on the Spotify web player. When a song with no native lyrics is played or a song is played but , it fetches the lyrics from the Lyrics.ovh API and displays them in a customized overlay.
